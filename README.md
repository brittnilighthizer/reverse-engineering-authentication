# Reverse Engineering Authentication

```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Context

When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

* A link to a Google Doc or video explaining the application in `Develop/`. 

In a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.
